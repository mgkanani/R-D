Docker and Rocket:-
  Design differences :-
    Both uses systemd for creating contrainers but in different ways. Docker follows client-server architecture. User 
    communicates to docker-daemon using docker-client. client requests daemon to create docker container. Since docker
    -daemon is creating container instead of client, this makes difficult to control containers for systemd. Docker 
    daemon controls contrainers. While in case of Rocket, systemd controls the contrainers.
    
  
User's point of view:-
  -Deploying docker container on core-os is time consuming.
  -Docker's end-user interfaces are attractive compared to Rocket.
  
  -Monolyth
  - 1+ year in real production environment.
  
  //-there were security flaws running on other platform(containerizing it using lxc).

Rocket:-
  -systemd as init system for linux distribution.
Strictly maintains the modularities, each piece is independent from another. e.g. Building image is seperate from image discovery.
