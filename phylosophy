There are two types of phylosophy which are more or less similar:-
1)Hardware virtualization
2)Clustering

In hardware virtualiztion solutions, you are not worrying about underlying hardware and how it is happening.
In clustering solutions, to solve your problem you are not worrying about how many machines are used and 
which machine is performing which task.
